> Grumpy Cat <

Tardar Sauce was perhaps, the most NOT amused cat to live. In fact, this is what would lead her to being famously known as "Grumpy Cat".
While other feline friends would cuddle, mew, purr, and play along with their humans, she refuses to take part in such ridiculous antics.
Maybe she's just planning something? How to get rid of her human? Obtaining all the catnip for herself? World domination?
One thing is for certain though. She is most assuredly, sick of your s**t.
