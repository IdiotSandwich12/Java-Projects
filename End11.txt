> Graves' Cigar <

Being an outlaw is tiring. After all, you're constantly on the run, and you can't really trust anybody. This was the case for Graves.
Carrying a heavy double barreled hextech shotgun, affectionately named "Destiny", he's had more than his fair share of conflicts.
But sometimes, a man's gotta relax. Graves looks to his stash of cigars for this. As he fumbled around his coat pockets for them, he couldn't find them. At all.
A horrible realization had dawned on him. The Riot Gods had taken them away from him. Probably because it risked violating the T for Teens rating.
A loud "NOOOOOO!" echoed into the distance.
