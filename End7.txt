There was once a Roman centurion, armored from head to toe, dressed for battle, and masked with the image of a stoic warrior.
His gladius was an extension of his arm, and his fist, an extension of his conviction.
In battles, Latin warcries could be heard by his allies and enemies. But there was one word in particular that stood out.
"Incredibilis"
