Narrator: I probably don't need to tell you this, but you're in some serious danger. Let's get out of here, yeah?
playerName: Y-yeah. Where do we go though?
(The Narrator points to a nearby cave to his right.)
Narrator: That'll do it. It'll be good cover while I set up the Portal. Pretty sure lizard man over there can't smash through it.
playerName: Seems...awfully convenient, don't you think? Almost like a deus ex machina.
Narrator: A deus ex what? Screw it, whatever the hell. Let's move it!

(Both you and the Narrator make a mad dash for the cave.)
Narrator: Come on, come on! Hurry your ass up and get in!
(You run into the cave. The Narrator conjures green energy that fits the cave entrance, before settling into stone, sealing the entry.)
