(At last, you've come to gates of Kar'm's fortress. The lair of the big baddie; the lion's den itself.)
(The fortress was huge; the outer walls composed of metal and stone. It's design was very similar to that of a castle, though far larger in height and size.)
Narrator: The gates are closed. As to be expected, it's not like Kar'm's just gonna let us waltz in there.
(The Narrator raises his staff, and utters an enchantment. Green energy flows from the worn wooden object and forms an oval directly on the large steel gate.)
(An image of what appears to be...the other side suddenly forms on the green oval. Oh! It's a portal!)
Narrator: Come on then. Hurry up and get in! I'll follow you through.

(You jump through the portal...and unsurprisingly, find Kar'm, standing in the courtyard on the other side, already prepared for the inevitable battle betwen you both.)
Kar'm: WELCOME! TO MY MOST HUMBLE ABODE. I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T COME, THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE MY FEARS WERE CERTAINLY MISPLACED.
(The Narrator, as he said he would, appeared beside you, staff at the ready.)
Narrator: You've probably never wielded a meme's actual power, so it's gonna be a strange first experience.
Narrator: Just remember to focus the energies towards your target. Might wanna clench your buttcheeks too, I heard it helps.
