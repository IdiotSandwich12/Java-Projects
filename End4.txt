> Good Guy Greg <

There once was a man named Greg, who was perhaps, the nicest person to ever exist in the Datascape. 
He could never be seen without a weed blunt in his mouth, and his signature smile present on his face.
Whatever assistance one needed, he would always be there to help. Whether it be carrying things, fixing a problem, or simply answering a question, he would always offer a hand.
He was eventually offered the status of a Saint, but declined politely, to which surprised nobody.
His kind actions are spoken of as tales to inspire children.
