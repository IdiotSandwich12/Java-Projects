???: You don't remember anything huh? Typical. Everyone coming here so far has been like that. Huh? Who am I? I'm the Narrator, but that s**t ain't important.
Narrator: Take a nice look at your immediate surroundings, yeah? 
Narrator: Everything you see here, all these bits and pieces, that piece of whatever the s**t you're standing on, and hell, even you, are all pieces of data here.
Narrator: What kind? Don't ask, hell if I know.

(The one known as the Narrator appears to be an enigmatic figure.)
(He is a slighty tanned man, dressed in a dark brown robe, and carrying a medium size satchel with the strap looped across his left shoulder.)
(You spot a worn looking wooden staff resting at an angle in his arms. His face is partially obscured by the hood of his robe.)

Narrator: I'd love to tell you more, but we've got bigger problems. Literally. 
Narrator: See, that big, mean, reptile looking mother hubbard over there is trying to make your bad day even worse.

(The person known as Narrator points to a massive reptilian looking creature behind you. Its massive three story height towers over you.)
(The reptilian creature...person...is donning a fancy looking suit and tie, and is clutching a black suitcase in his right hand as he adjusts his tie in with his left.)

???: GREETINGS, LOWLY NORMIE OF THE EARTHLY REALM. 
Kar'm: IT IS I, THE LORD OF DATA ROBBERY, THE KEEPER OF THE TOME OF A MILLION FACES, THE ALL POWERFUL AND MIGHTY, GERBREKCUZ K'ARM.
Kar'm: I WILL DEMOLISH YOU TO NOTHINGNESS! I WILL ANNIHILATE THE VERY FIBER OF YOUR BEING, GRAND MEMER!

Kar'm: YOU AND YOUR ORDER HAVE BEEN A THORN IN MY SIDE FOR FAR TOO LONG!
Kar'm: AND ONCE YOU ARE GONE, THERE WILL BE NO OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF MY DOMINATION OVER THIS DIGITAL REALM! MWHUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Kar'm: AH...HMM. WHAT DO YOU GO BY AGAIN? ALL YOU HUMANS APPEAR THE SAME TO ME. NOT THAT IT MATTERS OF COURSE.
Kar'm: YOU'LL SIMPLY BE ANOTHER PATHETIC WEAKLING TO BE CRUSHED. SINCE YOU'RE STILL ALIVE THOUGH, I SUPPOSE I SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW YOUR NAME.
Kar'm: IT WILL MAKE MY TRIUMPH OVER YOU THAT MUCH GREATER! These history books don't write themselves, you know.
