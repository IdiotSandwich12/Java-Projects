(Both of you struggled immensely, trying to outdo each other's power, for the fate of this world had depended on it!)
(You could feel Kar'm's intense energy, only matched by that of your own. Both of you had the fiercest determination, and the clearest of goals.)
(And in that moment, you developed a respect for him. Even though he was the enemy who tried to destroy you first, you felt that you could almost understand him.)
(Driving out the distracting thoughts in your head, you pushed onwards. Harder! Better! Faster! Stronger!)
(You could feel Kar'm's energy being pushed back, slowly, but steadily.)

(The Narrator was preoccupied with stopping the blue energy hammer and sword; he would be of no assistance to you.)
(But you didn't need his help. Not anymore, not this time.)
(Letting out a scream from the depths of your soul, you make one final effort, the purple energy intensifying in color.)
(Kar'm's eyes widened, as in the same moment, his guard broke, and he was enveloped by the full force of your attack.)
(The lizard man was sent flying backwards, and crashed into a wall, fracturing it.)
(The bluish energy that Kar'm had summoned earlier disappated, and you weren't sure what would happen to it.)
(Walking over to Kar'm's now severly damaged figure, you knelt down beside him, staying silent. Words would not be necessary to convey how you felt.)
Kar'm: To be...ARGH...defeated by a mere child! This...ARGH...is most certainly....ARGH...embarrasing.
(To your surprise, he let a genuine smile onto his lips.)
Kar'm: You...fought well. Fought well...indeed.
(Those were his final words. He was still after that. Moments later, he disintegrated into millions of pieces, into data, that was going to be reincorporated into other beings. Most likely, anyways.)
(You thought of home, now that your duty had been completed. How were you going to get home?)

Narrator: Hey kid! Get over here, I found something you'll definitely be interested in!
(You ran in the direction of the Narrator's voice. Turns out, he wasn't too far away, just in on the of the adjacent buildings connected to the courtyard.)
Narrator: Look at this! It's a portal! Completely seperate from an casting entity and on its own, but still functioning!
(The portal in question was red, and was generated from a highly technological looking framebase. But what caught your attention was what you could see on the other side of the portal.)
(Your home. Your bedroom, and the computer that you were working on days ago. How much time had passed since you came into Datascape?)
(Everything looked the same as when you left. Nobody seems to have noticed you missing. Maybe time passed differently in the Datascape?)
Narrator: Now's your chance. Home sweet home is right on the other side.
Narrator: Gotta say. I think I'll miss your spunk, kid. You've done well, for someone so inexperienced. Thanks for doing your duty, 46th Grand Memer.
(He smiled at you thankfully, and gestured towards the portal.)
(You thank him for his help, for everything, before shaking his hand, and jumping through the red energy separating you from home.)

Narrator: "Well now, old friend. Finally bit the dust now, haven't we?", he said to nobody in particular, as he strolled past where Kar'm used to be.
Picking up the now ownerless suitcase, he closed it shut.
Narrator: "This belongs to me now. You've done your part...and that stupid kid has as well." A smirk on his face grew, and quickly changed into something sinister.
Suitcase and staff in both hands, he walked to the fortress's throne room, and filled the empty seat on the far side.
Narrator: "Now then. It's time for a new era..."
