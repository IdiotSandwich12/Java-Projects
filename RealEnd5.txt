(The atmosphere changed as you and the Narrator came to the countryside. The entirety of this area was composed of farming settlements, sectioned off from one another with basic fencing.)
(Everyone here appeared to be miserable. These peasants wore very basic clothing, soiled with dirt, as they toiled away in the fields, hoes and shovels in hand.)
(Many of them were clearly exhausted...a definite sign of being overworked. Was it forced labor?)
Narrator: I feel bad for these poor folks. Never asked for anything of this...hmm...
Narrator: We gotta keep moving. Once we take care of Kar'm, things will be back to normal again. We can help these people by doing our jobs.
(You wanted to argue, but you knew he was right. Any help you gave now would just be short term.)
