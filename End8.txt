He had to think. His castle was being sieged, by an old friend turned foe. Nonetheless, he had to come up with a strategy to drive the enemy army back.
His forces were outnumbered, and he did not wish to see the blood of his own men spilled.
Suddenly, he heard the cries. 
"DAUBENY! DAUBENY, SHOW YOURSELF!"
And so the Warden known as Daubeny did. In all his glory, he presented himself to the Lawbringer that was set out to kill or capture him.
"THESE WARRIORS DON'T HAVE TO DIE. TRIAL BY COMBAT, RIGHT NOW!", yelled the Lawbringer.
Daubeny responded, "Fight you?! That's not a trial! That's an execution!"
The Lawbringer challenged the Warden to fight his second in command, to which he offered up his own "second".
Daubeny's second won. The Lawbringer, disappointed in his defeat and intrigued by the other second's skill, knighted her, and took her under his wing.
Though Daubeny had suffered a loss, he gathered his forces and fled, living to fight another day, plotting his future revenge.
