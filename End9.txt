Legends speak of two incredibly skilled martial artists, who used laser swords and wielded a mysterious energy field known only as "The Force".
These two martial artist were called Jedi, a name only given to those who have mastered both the Force and their laser swords.
Initially brother in arms, one of these Jedi's heart grew dark, and out of what he perceived as an attempt to save his beloved, betrayed everyone around him.
The two came to clash, dueling over a facility on a lava planet. The fight was spectacular, though the death battle came to an end eventually.
One of the Jedi, lept to higher ground and challenged the other, daring him to jump. The other did, and thus the battle came to an end.
The Jedi with a dark heart had lost. Missing an arm and both his legs from the waist down, he was left to die on the lava planet of Mustafar.
But fate had other plans for him...
