???: You ever have those moments where you have no f***ing idea what's going on?
???: Where you're lost as s**t and just waiting for some fairy light looking thing to explain what kinda pickle you're in? Oh hey there, kid. You're finally awake.

(Uhh, my head. Last thing I remember, I was browsing dank memes and programming Java for my evil boss. Where am I?)

???: You don't remember anything huh? Typical. Everyone coming here so far has been like that. Huh? Who am I? I'm the Narrator, but that s**t ain't important.
Narrator: Take a nice look at your immediate surroundings, yeah? 
Narrator: Everything you see here, all these bits and pieces, that piece of whatever the s**t you're standing on, and hell, even you, are all pieces of data here.
Narrator: What kind? Don't ask, hell if I know.

(The one known as the Narrator appears to be an enigmatic figure.)
(He is a slighty tanned man, dressed in a dark brown robe, and carrying a medium size satchel with the strap looped across his left shoulder.)
(You spot a worn looking wooden staff resting at an angle in his arms. His face is partially obscured by the hood of his robe.)

Narrator: I'd love to tell you more, but we've got bigger problems. Literally. 
Narrator: See, that big, mean, reptile looking mother hubbard over there is trying to make your bad day even worse.

(The person known as Narrator points to a massive reptilian looking creature behind you. Its massive three story height towers over you.)
(The reptilian creature...person...is donning a fancy looking suit and tie, and is clutching a black suitcase in his right hand as he adjusts his tie in with his left.)

???: GREETINGS, LOWLY NORMIE OF THE EARTHLY REALM. 
Kar'm: IT IS I, THE LORD OF DATA ROBBERY, THE KEEPER OF THE TOME OF A MILLION FACES, THE ALL POWERFUL AND MIGHTY, GERBREKCUZ K'ARM.
Kar'm: I WILL DEMOLISH YOU TO NOTHINGNESS! I WILL ANNIHILATE THE VERY FIBER OF YOUR BEING, GRAND MEMER!

Kar'm: YOU AND YOUR ORDER HAVE BEEN A THORN IN MY SIDE FOR FAR TOO LONG!
Kar'm: AND ONCE YOU ARE GONE, THERE WILL BE NO OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF MY DOMINATION OVER THIS DIGITAL REALM! MWHUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Kar'm: AH...HMM. WHAT DO YOU GO BY AGAIN? ALL YOU HUMANS APPEAR THE SAME TO ME. NOT THAT IT MATTERS OF COURSE.
Kar'm: YOU'LL SIMPLY BE ANOTHER PATHETIC WEAKLING TO BE CRUSHED. SINCE YOU'RE STILL ALIVE THOUGH, I SUPPOSE I SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW YOUR NAME.
Kar'm: IT WILL MAKE MY TRIUMPH OVER YOU THAT MUCH GREATER! These history books don't write themselves, you know.

Kar'm: Oh, cool. I mean, QUITE AN...UNINTERESTING NAME. NOW THEN, PREPARE TO DIE, FILTH.
(K'arm raises his staff, and directs bluish white energy at you, in the shape of the letters "FB".)

(Before the attack hits you however, the Narrator raises his hand, and blocks the attack with a greenish haze of energy.)
Kar'm: WHAT'S THIS?! YOU CAN NULLIFY MY BAN MAGIC? VERY WELL. HAVE SOME OF THIS! TERMS OF SERVICE VIOLATION!
(Kar'm reels back with his left fist, before zooming it towards you and the Narrator.)
Narrator: You! Shall not! Pass!
(The Narrator raises his staff before slamming it into the ground, raising his hand upwards as he created a green haze in the shape of a closed hand, with the middle finger protruding.)
(Kar'm fist collides with the green haze, stopping it instantly, as if by...magic.)

Narrator: I probably don't need to tell you this, but you're in some serious danger. Let's get out of here, yeah?
playerName: Y-yeah. Where do we go though?
(The Narrator points to a nearby cave to his right.)
Narrator: That'll do it. It'll be good cover while I set up the Portal. Pretty sure lizard man over there can't smash through it.
playerName: Seems...awfully convenient, don't you think? Almost like a deus ex machina.
Narrator: A deus ex what? Screw it, whatever the hell. Let's move it!

(Both you and the Narrator make a mad dash for the cave.)
Narrator: Come on, come on! Hurry your ass up and get in!
(You run into the cave. The Narrator conjures green energy that fits the cave entrance, before settling into stone, sealing the entry.)

> User input here <

(The Narrator raises his staff with his left hand, and streches out his right. He directs a wave of glowing green energy that pools on the floor, allowing you to see.)
(The energy splits, and quickly morphs into two doors. The one on the right is blue, with the one on the left being red.)
Narrator: Alrighty, here kid. Pick a door. A little birdy told me someone would be falling into Datascape, so I had these prepared ahead of time.
Narrator: Though I gotta admit, I forgot where they lead to. Doesn't matter I guess, as long as it's anywhere not here. Go ahead, pick one.

(The cave shakes suddenly, and you can hear booms and angry roars as Kar'm's attempts to get to both of you intensify.)
Narrator: Come on kid! Choose quickly!
