> Jager's ACOG <

A very smart German speedy boi, once had a very powerful rifle, known as the HK416-Carbine. It had high damage, and was deadly accurate.
What made this weapon extraordinary however, was an ACOG sight, allowing him to zoom in and see from further away.
Combined together, this made for an overpowering weapon, capable of stopping attackers before they could even move into the objective building.
Overlord Ubisoft heard the complaints of the other operators, and wisely decided to remove his ACOG. Now, Jager is only a shell of his former self.
