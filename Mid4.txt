Narrator: Hmm...it's a bit difficult to describe accurately, but as I mentioned before, it's a digital realm. The rules that govern your world, don't apply here.
Narrator: Everything that exists here is data. I suppose it's a 3-dimensional manifestation of the internet that can be viewed and manipulated.
Narrator: All significant things on the modern internet have their representations here. Changes to them will reflect here as well, and vice versa.
Narrator: Kar'm figured this out you see, and now he's trying to change the actual internet by screwing with the state of things here.
