(You've been following the Narrator for a while, walking with him in silence. There wasn't much to talk about though, so you steeled yourself for the Herculean task ahead.)
(Eventually, both of you come to a yellow brick road. The Narrator turns around, nods at you knowingly, and begins moving towards the end of the brick road. You follow anticipatingly.)
(You both stop outside an decripit looking building. Stepping in with the Narrator however, you find that it is actually well furnished.)
(There are bookshelves full of tomes surrrounding a bulky metal device.)
Narrator: Here we are. The Meme Machine. It's not in the best condition, but then again, it is kinda ancient.
(The Meme Machine appears to be made of steel and some other kind of metal. It is large, old, and worn, the latter two due to its age.)
Narrator: Here, lemme show you how it works. There's a covering that can only be moved by a Grand Memer. Once you remove it, place both your hands into the basin to summon a meme.
Narrator: I should warn you though, its kinda random. Even Grand Memers can't control the outcome of what's created; they can only use them.
Narrator: You need Knowledge to summon a meme. Each summon costs 100 Knowledge. As long as ya got enough, you can do it.
Narrator: See these texts around? Read them, and you'll gain Knowledge.
Narrator: As I've said before, not all memes are created equal. Some are far stronger than normal. These are known as "dank memes".
Narrator: Normal memes are worth 1 Power. Dank memes are far more rare, and are worth 3 Power.
Narrator: You'll need the force of AT LEAST 7 Power in order to overpower Kar'm and defeat him.
Narrator: Well, now that you know the rules, go on, give it a try.
