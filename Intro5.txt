Narrator: Alrighty, here kid. Pick a door. A little birdy told me someone would be falling into Datascape, so I had these prepared ahead of time.
Narrator: Though I gotta admit, I forgot where they lead to. Doesn't matter I guess, as long as it's anywhere not here. Go ahead, pick one.

(The cave shakes suddenly, and you can hear booms and angry roars as Kar'm's attempts to get to both of you intensify.)
Narrator: Come on kid! Choose quickly!
