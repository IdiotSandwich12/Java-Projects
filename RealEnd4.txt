(It was a long journey to Kar'm's territory, but you've finally arrived. It's certainly not what you expected...but at the same time, it kinda was.)
Narrator: Whew. Haven't made such a trip in a long ass time. Last time I came to thia area, was when...

Narrator: ...nevermind, kid. Let's just keep going. Kar'm should be in his fortress somewhere. Currently, we're only on the outskirts of his domain.
(He gave a thoughful hum, and tapped his foot for a few moments.)
Narrator: That means we should continue our journey...to the west.

(As you continued your travels westward, the two of you came across towns and villages. Life appeared extraordinarily normally.)
(Markets were filled with traders and customers, opening some sort of "menu" with a flick of their fingers, most likely to barter with. It floated in front of them, waiting for their commands.)
(Children ran amok, mothers tended to homes, and guards patrolled the streets for trouble.)
(Their residents were obviously busy with the tasks of everyday life, so few had the time to stop and stare at the obvious strangers.)
(The ones that did however, gave looks of curiousity, disgust, or apprehension, and perhaps a mix of those.)
(They didn't appreciate the presence of outsiders, it seemed.)
(You decided wisely that it would be better for you and your companion to move away as quickly as your feet would allow. Trouble was the last thing you needed.)
