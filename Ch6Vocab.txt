Definitions and terms for Lab 8

1. Actual parameter - variables/values used when method is invoked. Different from formal parameter.

2. Ambiguous invocation - when there are 2 possible invocations of a method. Causes a compile error.

3. Argument - another term for an actual parameter.

4. Divide and conquer - strategy used in programming, particularly with larger programs, that involves separating a program into
smaller, more managable components to work on one by one.

5. Formal parameter - variables defined in the method header.

6. Information hiding - when implementation details are encapsulated in the method and hidden from client that invokes a method.

7. Method - collection of statements grouped together to perform a certain operation.

8. Method abstraction - achieved by separating the use of a method from its implementation.

9. Method overloading - when two methods have the same name, but different parameters within a class.

10. Method signature - consists of the method name and parameter list.

11. Modifier - determines type of method. Belongs in the method header.

12. Parameter - another term for formal parameter.

13. Pass-by-value - a value of an argument that is passed to the parameter, done upon invoking a method.

14. Scope of a variable - the range of a variable.

15. Stepwise refinement - another term for the "divide and conquer" strategy

16. Stub - simple, but incomplete version of a method
