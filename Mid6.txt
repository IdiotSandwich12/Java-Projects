Narrator: Hang on.
Narrator: I should mention that there are other enforcers out there: regular Memers. Though they aren't nearly as powerful as you are, and have less potential to wield the memes.
Narrator: Even all of them combined are no match for Kar'm.
(The Narrator takes out a small book from his satchel, and flips through it.)
Narrator: Sorry, it's been so long since the last one that I forgot the actual definition. Right, here we are.
Narrator: And Saint Pepe proclaimed that, the MemeLord hadst told him, that therein shalt be a Grand Memer, one raised every generation. 
Narrator: Thee duties shalt be fulfilled in order to securest a most lasting peace.
Narrator: Thine shalt: enforce justice where needed, maintain thee balance of thisin realm, and continue thine efforts to keepeth thee peace and harmony for all.
Narrator: There ya go, kid. Justice, balance, and peace.
Narrator: Obviously, Kar'm's invasion has screwed up basically all of these. It's up to you to get rid of him and restore those three principles back to the Datascape.
Narrator: But uhh, no pressure, eh kid?
