> Pepe the Frog <

There once was a saint who brought peace, harmony, and prosperity to Datascape. In all his green skinned glory, he taught the residents of this realm how to harness the power of memes.
Granted permission by the creators of this world, Saint Pepe decreed that there be Memers and Grand Memers to care for and maintain the memes. 
They would also serve as protectors of Datascape, for the generation after he was gone.
He was loved by all, until his great fall. Consumed by an unknown darkness, Saint Pepe succumbed to evil and became a symbol of hate for a group known only as the "Alt-Right".
Before he could be fully consumed by the darkness; however, he sealed his existence as a meme, effectively immortalizing himself, at the cost of his life.
Nonetheless, his influence has not waned. Many know his story, though even more feel the work he has done.
