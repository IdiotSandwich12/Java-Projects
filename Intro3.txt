(Before the attack hits you however, the Narrator raises his hand, and blocks the attack with a greenish haze of energy.)
Kar'm: WHAT'S THIS?! YOU CAN NULLIFY MY BAN MAGIC? VERY WELL. HAVE SOME OF THIS! TERMS OF SERVICE VIOLATION!
(Kar'm reels back with his left fist, before zooming it towards you and the Narrator.)
Narrator: You! Shall not! Pass!
(The Narrator raises his staff before slamming it into the ground, raising his hand upwards as he created a green haze in the shape of a closed hand, with the middle finger protruding.)
(Kar'm fist collides with the green haze, stopping it instantly, as if by...magic.)
