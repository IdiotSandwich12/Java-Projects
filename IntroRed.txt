Narrator: The red one, eh? Alrighty, let's get in there.
(You push the door and the left and enter, and the Narrator follows you quickly as he disintegrates both doors with a wave of his hand.)

(The other side of the door is peculiar. You can see what appear to be forum topics floating everywhere, but also neatly lined up in a readble fashion.)
(They range from everything you can think of. From cooking, to cars, to glorius memes, there seems to be something for everone.)
(Shifting your eyes to the left, you spot a strange...humanoid looking robot thing, with red eyes and an antenna sticking out of its head. It's waving to you, with a smile on its face.)

Narrator: Oh yes. THAT'S where I linked it to. Well kid, I'm assuming you know where this is, but I'll introduce you anyways.
Narrator: Welcome, to Reddit!
