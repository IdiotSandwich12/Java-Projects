Narrator: The Facebook Nation, led by Kar'm, quickly conquered much of the Datascape. Kar'm then proceeded to rule this realm with an iron grip, crushing all opposition and dissidents.
Narrator: He had the previous Grand Memer executed. It seems that fate has chosen you as the next one.
Narrator: Granted, if you don't succeed here, another Grand Memer will eventually rise. But that means you'll also die, so....
Narrator: Yeah. You kinda wanna kick Kar'm's ass, is what I'm saying.
