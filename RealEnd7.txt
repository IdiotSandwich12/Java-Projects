Kar'm: LET US END THIS. I WILL, AT THE VERY LEAST, GIVE YOU THE HONOR OF ENDING YOU RIGHTLY. You are gonna be in the history books after all.
Kar'm: NOW THEN! PREPARE TO DIE. FACEBOOK BANHAMMER!
(Kar'm raises his hand, before quickly lowering it again. A massive blue and white energy hammer materializes on top of you and attemmpts to smash you, before being stopped by a wave of green energy.)
(Another massive blue energy blade appears to your right, swinging at you, but stopping at the last moment, thanks to another shield of green energy.)
Narrator: Now's not the time to freeze up, kid! Get your head in the game! Hurry up and get those memes onto the playing field!
(You glance at him and nod quickly, before beginning the summoning ritual. One by one, the memes materialize in their forms, slighty ethereal and filled with energy.)

(Kar'm's eyes widen, before narrowing again in focus.)
Kar'm: SO. YOU'VE DISCOVERED THE ANCIENT POWERS THE ELDER ANCESTORS WOULD WIELD. LET'S SEE HOW WELL YOU HANDLE IT THEN!
(Kar'm sets down the suitcase in his left hand, and opens it. Bluish energy rushes out, and readies itself in both of Kar'm's hands.)
(He thrusts his arms out in front of him, palms open, and channels the bluish hue of power. You can hear the faint screaming of...people?)
Kar'm: MY MOST POWERFUL ATTACK! THE SOUL BLAST, AGAINST YOUR MEMES. LET'S SEE WHO WILL TRIUMPH!
(His voice was clearly strained in effort, but he never took his attention away from you, or the energy that was forming alarmingly quickly in his palms.)
(You knew what had to be done.)
(Gathering the energy of the memes, you willed them into one formation, to face Kar'm's Soul Blast head on. Purple energies flowed freely from the memes, before rushing forward to meet the dastardly blue onslaught.)
