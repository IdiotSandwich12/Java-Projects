(The Narrator had his own problems: he was concentrating on stopping the hammer and the sword that was still there. Getting sliced in half of bashed to a pulp would not be good right now.)

(You could feel yourself disintegrating, the very fiber of your being being consumed as the screaming grew louder, and louder.)

(He only said two words.) 
("No, kid!")
(And everything went black, and ceased to exist...)
